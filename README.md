# Data Visualization Using Python

## Overview
This repository showcases the work I completed during the "Data Visualization Using Python" certification course on Great Learning. The course focused on building proficiency in Python libraries and techniques to create impactful and insightful data visualizations. I applied these skills through hands-on exercises using real-world datasets, including `games.csv` and `Automobile.csv`.

## Key Learning Outcomes
### Tools and Libraries Mastered:
- **Matplotlib**: For creating publication-ready, precise visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For generating aesthetically appealing and statistically insightful plots.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation, preprocessing, and analysis.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations to explore datasets dynamically.

### Core Skills Developed:
- Preprocessing raw datasets to ensure clean and analyzable data.
- Visualizing relationships, trends, and distributions using line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
- Creating dashboards and multi-visual layouts for actionable insights.
- Statistical analysis and correlation visualization.

## Datasets Used
### 1. `games.csv`
- **Description**: Contains information about games, such as their popularity, ratings, and other relevant metrics.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Bar plots to showcase the most popular games by ratings.
  - Scatter plots to analyze relationships between variables (e.g., popularity vs. ratings).
  - Heatmaps to understand correlations between various features.

### 2. `Automobile.csv`
- **Description**: A dataset containing information about different automobiles, including features like price, horsepower, and fuel efficiency.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Box plots to identify outliers in price and horsepower.
  - Line plots for trend analysis (e.g., fuel efficiency over time).
  - Pair plots to explore relationships between multiple numerical attributes.

## Key Highlights
- **Interactive and Static Visuals**: Combined interactive visuals using Plotly with static visuals from Matplotlib and Seaborn for comprehensive analysis.
- **Hands-On Projects**: Exercises focused on solving real-world analytical problems through data visualization.
- **Actionable Insights**: Extracted meaningful patterns and trends to support decision-making processes.


## Conclusion
This course has refined my ability to visualize and communicate data-driven insights effectively. By combining powerful Python libraries with robust datasets, I am now better equipped to tackle analytical challenges in data science and analytics.
